# Parking Spot Reminder Application
## Project Overview
The Parking Spot Reminder Application allows users to save their parking spots and navigate to them easily. Users can access their saved spots, get directions, and add notes about the parking location. This project was developed using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Features
**User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to their accounts.                                                                                                                                            
**Save Parking Spots:** Users can save their current parking locations with notes (e.g., floor level, nearby landmarks).                                                                                           
**Map Integration:** Displays the user's current location on a map and allows navigation to saved spots.                                                                                                          
**Navigating to Spot:** User can navigate to the saved spot easily with help of notes and map.                                                                                                                      
**Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
